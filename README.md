# gcpe-news-api-client
C# Client for BC Gov News API.
======================
 
Introduction
----------------
The code of this client is generated by autorest and allows a C# MVC web application to easily
consume the BC Government News API.  The build script pushes a nuget package, and does not produce any container images.

Repository Map
--------------
- .s2i : Source to image bash assemble script
- **Gov.News.Api.Client**: C# Dotnet Core class Library

Installation
------------
In an OpenShift "Tools" or build project, add the objects contained in the OpenShift\Templates folder.

`oc process -f build-template.json | oc create -f -`

- Once the build template is processed and imported, the following will need to be done:

1.  Set the NUGET_KEY environment variable with your NUGET Key. (if you do not do this, the build will not push the Nuget package to nuget.org)
2. Configure a github hook such that a commit to this repository will trigger a build.
	
Developer Prerequisites
-----------------------

**Gov.News.Api.Client**
- Node.js 
- Visual Studio 2017
- Dotnet Core 2.2

**DevOps**
- OpenShift Container Platform 3.6 or newer (Origin is supported)
- RedHat OpenShift tools
- Docker
- Centos Linux  
- A familiarity with Jenkins

Development
-----------
A Visual Studio 2017 solution has been provided, however Visual Studio Pro is not required to run the build script. 

*Important*

You will need to install Autorest prior to building the source.
`npm install -g autorest`

You may have to run the build more than once initially if using Visual Studio.  

Removing a package
------------------
Note that nuget.org maps delete to unlist.

If you wish to remove a package from nuget.org or another nuget repository, issue the following command:

`nuget delete Gov.News.Api.Client <version-to-remove> -Source nuget.org -ApiKey <key>`

(key is your Nuget.org key)
